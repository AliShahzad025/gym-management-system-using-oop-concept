This C++ Gym Management System implements robust functionalities for managing members, trainers, equipment, sessions, and payments.
Administrators can efficiently add, update, and remove entities, while members benefit from attendance tracking, access to gym timings, and convenient fee payment options.
Staff attendance logging and visitor information provision further enhance user experience.


The system employs Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as inheritance and polymorphism.
Inheritance facilitates code reusability and organization, enabling subclasses to inherit attributes and methods from a superclass. 
Polymorphism enables unique behavior implementation for functions like display() in derived classes, enhancing code flexibility and maintainability.
Encapsulation ensures data integrity and abstraction by encapsulating data within classes.


User authentication differentiates between administrators and members, requiring an admin password for privileged access, ensuring data security.
Data management utilizes arrays and file handling techniques for efficient storage and retrieval of gym-related information.


In summary, this Gym Management System exemplifies OOP concepts, enhancing code modularity, reusability, and maintainability
while providing comprehensive functionalities for gym management.


This code serves various functions such as:

Admin Management
Payment Process
Attendance
Gym Timings
Visitor Information
Trainer Management
Member Management
Equipment Management
User Authentication
